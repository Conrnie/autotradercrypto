# üåô Moon Dev AI Trading System - Quick Start Guide

## üéâ System Built Successfully!

Your Volume Profile Mean Reversion AI Trading System is ready to run!

---

## üìã System Overview

### Core Components

**4 Active Agents:**
1. **Risk Agent** - Monitors portfolio health, enforces position limits and PnL thresholds
2. **Liquidation Agent** - Tracks market liquidation events for context
3. **Strategy Agent** - Scans 11 symbols √ó 2 timeframes = 22 markets for Volume Profile signals
4. **Trading Agent** - DeepSeek AI analyzes and confirms every trade

### Strategy: Volume Profile Mean Reversion Scalper

**Objective:** Scalp mean reversion toward POC from statistical extremes

**Entry Conditions:**
- Developed volume profile (50-120 candle lookback)
- Price touches ¬±1œÉ or ¬±2œÉ
- Next candle closes back inside value area
- ATR between 0.15%-0.55%

**Exit Conditions:**
- Take profit: 0.9√ó distance to POC
- Stop loss: Beyond ¬±2œÉ with buffer
- Timeout: 15 candles

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All settings are in `src/config.py`:

### Trading Parameters

```python
# Capital
TESTNET_CAPITAL = 1000  # $1000 mock capital

# Symbols (Top 10 + Zcash)
HYPERLIQUID_SYMBOLS = ['BTC', 'ETH', 'SOL', 'BNB', 'XRP', 'ADA',

```

### AI Settings

```python
AI_MODEL_TYPE = "deepseek"
AI_MODEL = "deepseek-reasoner"
AI_TEMPERATURE = 0.3       # Lower = more precise

```

### Risk Management

```python
MAX_LOSS_USD = 25          # Max loss before stopping

## üß™ Testing Individual Components

### Test Volume Profile Strategy

```bash
cd src/strategies
python volume_profile_strategy.py
```

This will:
- Fetch BTC 1m data
- Calculate volume profile
- Check if profile is "developed"
- Generate a signal if conditions are met

### Test Strategy Agent

```bash
cd src/agents
python strategy_agent.py
```

This will:
- Initialize all 22 strategies (11 symbols √ó 2 timeframes)
- Scan all markets
- Display any signals found

### Test Trading Agent (DeepSeek Confirmation)

```bash
cd src/agents
python trading_agent.py
```

This will:
- Load DeepSeek AI model
- Test with a sample signal
- Show AI's approval/rejection reasoning

## üìà Understanding the Output

### Volume Profile Analysis

```
üîç Analyzing BTC on 1m timeframe
‚úÖ Fetched 200 candles
üìä ATR: 0.350%
‚úÖ Found developed profile (Score: 85.5, Lookback: 80)
   POC: $45100.00
   Value Area: $44900.00 - $45300.00
   ¬±2œÉ Range: $44700.00 - $45500.00
üìà Current Price: $44850.00

üü¢ LONG SETUP DETECTED!
   Entry Level: 2œÉ

```

### DeepSeek AI Analysis

```

üì• DeepSeek Response:
APPROVE

This is a high-quality mean reversion setup:

1. Volume Profile Quality (Score: 85.5) - Excellent development
2. Entry at -2œÉ is ideal for mean reversion
3. R:R of 2.5:1 is favorable
4. ATR at 0.35% is in optimal range
5. Leverage of 8x is reasonable given the tight stop

ADJUST_LEVERAGE: 6x (slightly conservative given testnet)

‚úÖ TRADE APPROVED BY DEEPSEEK
‚öôÔ∏è DeepSeek adjusted leverage: 8x ‚Üí 6x
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Testnet Mode** - Currently configured for Hyperliquid testnet (no real money)
2. **AI Confirmation** - Every trade must be approved by DeepSeek
3. **Risk Limits** - Max loss/gain thresholds enforced
4. **Position Limits** - Max 10% per position
5. **Timeout Protection** - Positions auto-close after 15 candles
6. **Cash Reserve** - Always keeps 30% in cash

### Emergency Stops

- Risk Agent will halt trading if:
  - Balance falls below minimum
  - Max loss threshold reached
  - Max gain threshold reached (forces review)

---

## üìù Trade Logging

All trades are logged to: `src/data/trade_log.jsonl`

Each entry includes:
- Timestamp
- Symbol and direction
- Entry/target/stop prices
- Leverage and position size
- Volume profile data
- Strategy reasoning
- DeepSeek AI reasoning

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "DEEPSEEK_KEY not found"
Add your DeepSeek API key to `.env` file

### "HYPER_LIQUID_KEY not found"
Add your Hyperliquid private key to `.env` file (testnet wallet)

### "No data returned by API"
- Check internet connection
- Verify Hyperliquid testnet API is accessible
- Try a different symbol

### "No signals generated"
This is normal! Volume profiles are picky:
- Profile must be "developed" (quality score >70)
- Price must touch extremes and revert
- ATR must be in range
- Most cycles won't have signals

### "DeepSeek rejects all trades"
Also normal! DeepSeek is very critical:
- Low R:R ratio
- Poor volume profile quality
- High leverage risk
- Unfavorable market context

---

## üìä Performance Tracking

Monitor your system:

1. **Console Output** - Real-time cycle summaries
2. **Trade Log** - `src/data/trade_log.jsonl`
3. **Agent Data** - `src/data/*` directories

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Verify Testnet Setup

Make sure you're actually on Hyperliquid testnet:
- Check `config.py`: `HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET = True`
- Verify your testnet wallet has funds

### 2. Customize Settings

Tune the strategy to your preferences:
- Adjust timeframes
- Change symbols
- Modify risk limits
- Tweak volume profile parameters

### 3. Monitor Performance

Let the system run for 24 hours and review:
- How many signals were generated?
- How many were approved by DeepSeek?
- What was the approval rate?
- Are the setups logical?

### 4. Integrate Live Trading (When Ready)

Once you're confident with paper trading:
1. **DO NOT** rush to live trading
2. Test thoroughly on testnet first
3. Start with minimal capital
4. Gradually increase size
